2xx SUCCESS
226 IM USED

The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a
representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to
the current instance.

The actual current instance might not be available except by combining this
response with other previous or future responses, as appropriate for the
specific instance-manipulation(s). If so, the headers of the resulting instance
are the result of combining the headers from the 226 response and the other
instances, following the rules in section 13.5.3
[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-13.5.3] of the HTTP/1.1
specification.

The request MUST have included an A-IM header field listing at least one
instance-manipulation. The response MUST include an Etag header field giving the
entity tag of the current instance.

A response received with a status code of 226 MAY be stored by a cache and used
in reply to a subsequent request, subject to the HTTP expiration mechanism and
any Cache-Control headers, and to the requirements in section 10.6
[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229#section-10.6].

A response received with a status code of 226 MAY be used by a cache, in
conjunction with a cache entry for the base instance, to create a cache entry
for the current instance.
