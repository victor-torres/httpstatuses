3xx REDIRECTION
307 TEMPORARY REDIRECT

The target resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the user agent
MUST NOT change the request method if it performs an automatic redirection to
that URI.

Since the redirection can change over time, the client ought to continue using
the original effective request URI for future requests.

The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response containing a
URI reference for the different URI. The user agent MAY use the Location field
value for automatic redirection. The server's response payload usually contains
a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the different URI(s).

Note: This status code is similar to 302 Found, except that it does not allow
changing the request method from POST to GET. This specification defines no
equivalent counterpart for 301 Moved Permanently (RFC7238
[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7238], however, proposes defining the status code
308 Permanent Redirect for this purpose).
