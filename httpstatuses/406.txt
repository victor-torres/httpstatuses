4xx CLIENT ERROR
406 NOT ACCEPTABLE

The target resource does not have a current representation that would be
acceptable to the user agent, according to the proactive negotiation header
fields received in the request [1], and the server is unwilling to supply
a default representation.

The server SHOULD generate a payload containing a list of available
representation characteristics and corresponding resource identifiers from which
the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. A user agent MAY
automatically select the most appropriate choice from that list. However, this
specification does not define any standard for such automatic selection, as
described in RFC7231 Section 6.4.1
[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.1].
