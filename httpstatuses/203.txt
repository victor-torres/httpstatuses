2xx SUCCESS
203 NON-AUTHORITATIVE INFORMATION

The request was successful but the enclosed payload has been modified from that
of the origin server's 200 OK response by a transforming proxy [1].

This status code allows the proxy to notify recipients when a transformation has
been applied, since that knowledge might impact later decisions regarding the
content. For example, future cache validation requests for the content might
only be applicable along the same request path (through the same proxies).

The 203 response is similar to the Warning code of 214 Transformation Applied
[2], which has the advantage of being applicable to responses with any
status code.

A 203 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls [3].
