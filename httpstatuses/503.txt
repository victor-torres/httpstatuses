5xx SERVER ERROR
503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE

The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload
or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay.

The server MAY send a Retry-After header field [1] to suggest an
appropriate amount of time for the client to wait before retrying the request.

Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a server has to
use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers might simply refuse the
connection.
