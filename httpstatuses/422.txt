4xx CLIENT ERROR
422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY

The server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415
Unsupported Media Type [/415] status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of
the request entity is correct (thus a 400 Bad Request status code is
inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions.

For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains
well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML
instructions.
