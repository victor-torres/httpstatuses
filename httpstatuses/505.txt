5xx SERVER ERROR
505 HTTP VERSION NOT SUPPORTED

The server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version of HTTP
that was used in the request message.

The server is indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request
using the same major version as the client, as described in Section 2.6 of
RFC7230 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.6], other than with this
error message. The server SHOULD generate a representation for the 505 response
that describes why that version is not supported and what other protocols are
supported by that server.
