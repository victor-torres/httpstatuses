4xx CLIENT ERROR
414 REQUEST-URI TOO LONG

The server is refusing to service the request because the request-target [1] is
longer than the server is willing to interpret.

This rare condition is only likely to occur when a client has improperly
converted a POST request to a GET request with long query information, when the
client has descended into a "black hole" of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI
prefix that points to a suffix of itself) or when the server is under attack by
a client attempting to exploit potential security holes.

A 414 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls [2].
