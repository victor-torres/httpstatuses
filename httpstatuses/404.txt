4xx CLIENT ERROR
404 NOT FOUND

The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource
or is not willing to disclose that one exists.

A 404 status code does not indicate whether this lack of representation is
temporary or permanent; the 410 Gone status code is preferred over 404 if
the origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means, that the
condition is likely to be permanent.

A 404 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls [1].
