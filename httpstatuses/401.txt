4xx CLIENT ERROR
401 UNAUTHORIZED

The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication
credentials for the target resource.

The server generating a 401 response MUST send a WWW-Authenticate header field
[1] containing at least one challenge applicable to the target resource.

If the request included authentication credentials, then the 401 response
indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. The user
agent MAY repeat the request with a new or replaced Authorization header field
[2]. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response,
and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the
user agent SHOULD present the enclosed representation to the user, since it
usually contains relevant diagnostic information.
