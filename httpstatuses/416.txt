4xx CLIENT ERROR
416 REQUESTED RANGE NOT SATISFIABLE

None of the ranges in the request's Range header field [1] overlap the
current extent of the selected resource or that the set of ranges requested has
been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or
overlapping ranges.

For byte ranges, failing to overlap the current extent means that the
first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than the
current length of the selected representation. When this status code is
generated in response to a byte-range request, the sender SHOULD generate a
Content-Range header field specifying the current length of the selected
representation [2].

For example:

HTTP/1.1 416 Range Not Satisfiable
Date: Fri, 20 Jan 2012 15:41:54 GMT
Content-Range: bytes */47022


Note: Because servers are free to ignore Range, many implementations will simply
respond with the entire selected representation in a 200 OK response.
That is partly because most clients are prepared to receive a 200 OK to
complete the task (albeit less efficiently) and partly because clients might not
stop making an invalid partial request until they have received a complete
representation. Thus, clients cannot depend on receiving a 416 Range Not
Satisfiable response even when it is most appropriate.
