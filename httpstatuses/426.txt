4xx CLIENT ERROR
426 UPGRADE REQUIRED

The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might
be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.

The server MUST send an Upgrade header field in a 426 response to indicate the
required protocol(s) [1]

Example:

HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required
Upgrade: HTTP/3.0
Connection: Upgrade
Content-Length: 53
Content-Type: text/plain

This service requires use of the HTTP/3.0 protocol.
