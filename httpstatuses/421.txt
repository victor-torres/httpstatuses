4xx CLIENT ERROR
421 MISDIRECTED REQUEST

The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response.
This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the
combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.

Clients receiving a 421 Misdirected Request response from a server MAY retry the
request -- whether the request method is idempotent or not -- over a different
connection. This is possible if a connection is reused [1] or if an
alternative service is selected ALT-SVC
[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#ref-ALT-SVC].

This status code MUST NOT be generated by proxies.

A 421 response is cacheable by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls [2].
