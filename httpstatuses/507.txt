5xx SERVER ERROR
507 INSUFFICIENT STORAGE

The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable
to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.

This condition is considered to be temporary. If the request that received this
status code was the result of a user action, the request MUST NOT be repeated
until it is requested by a separate user action.
