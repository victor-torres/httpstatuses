3xx REDIRECTION
302 FOUND

The target resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the
redirection might be altered on occasion, the client ought to continue to use
the effective request URI for future requests.

The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response containing a
URI reference for the different URI. The user agent MAY use the Location field
value for automatic redirection. The server's response payload usually contains
a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the different URI(s).

Note: For historical reasons, a user agent MAY change the request method from
POST to GET for the subsequent request. If this behavior is undesired, the 307
Temporary Redirect status code can be used instead.
