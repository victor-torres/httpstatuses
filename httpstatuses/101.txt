1xx INFORMATIONAL
101 SWITCHING PROTOCOLS

The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via
the Upgrade header field [1], for a change in the application protocol
being used on this connection.

The server MUST generate an Upgrade header field in the response that indicates
which protocol(s) will be switched to immediately after the empty line that
terminates the 101 response.

It is assumed that the server will only agree to switch protocols when it is
advantageous to do so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP might
be advantageous over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous
protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.
