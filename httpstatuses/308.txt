3xx REDIRECTION
308 PERMANENT REDIRECT

The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future
references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references
to the effective request URI [1] to one or more of the new references sent
by the server, where possible.

The server SHOULD generate a Location header field [2] in the response
containing a preferred URI reference for the new permanent URI. The user agent
MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection. The server's
response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the
new URI(s).

A 308 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls [3].

Note: This status code is similar to 301 Moved Permanently, except that
it does not allow changing the request method from POST to GET.
