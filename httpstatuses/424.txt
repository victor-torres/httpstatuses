4xx CLIENT ERROR
424 FAILED DEPENDENCY

The method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action
depended on another action and that action failed.

For example, if a command in a PROPPATCH method fails, then, at minimum, the
rest of the commands will also fail with 424 Failed Dependency.
