4xx CLIENT ERROR
413 PAYLOAD TOO LARGE

The server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is
larger than the server is willing or able to process.

The server MAY close the connection to prevent the client from continuing the
request.

If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD generate a Retry-After header
field to indicate that it is temporary and after what time the client MAY try
again.
